# Vocas Shoulder Pad with Arca Quick Release

With this print you can add an Andoer CL-50LS to a Vocas 0370-0005 shoulder pad.  The Vocas part is discontinued, but easy to find used.

## Installation

The rectangular piece is inserted over the thread you wish to use. The cross piece is inserted into the base of the quick release clamp, with the concave side facing outward. Line up the cross piece with the corresponding cutout in the rectangular piece, and press together. Insert a screw through the quick release and tighten.
